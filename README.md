this app is a part of hobby for creating apps which will help people leaving in north bengal. there are not many apps made for that 
region. so, i have been in a mission of developing open source apps. as a part of that mission, i have created this app to have a 
forum for topics related to north bengal. for example, topics can be of development projects, railway, transport facilities, and 
similar things.

### migrating from react native
this is the rebuilt android app with kotlin and jetpack compose for [migrating from react native](http://github.com/prisar/kulik-rn)

the pervious version was causing difficulty in meeting the requirements of playstore. almost every year google asked to upgrade 
sdk version. while react native is good for javascript developers it also creates burrden of maintaining playstore reqirements. 
the react native uses relatively earlier versions of sdk. that's why i have decied to migrate to android itself.
